Title: I automated professional documentation generation (5 min vs 20 hours)

Body:

Hey r/webdev,

I spent the last month building an automated documentation generator after getting frustrated with how long it took to document my projects.

**The Problem:**
- Writing docs manually: 15-20 hours
- Hiring someone: $1,500-3,000
- Most developer READMEs: barely 20 lines
- Documentation gets outdated fast

**What I Built:**
- Automated doc generator
- 8 professional themes (Professional, Modern, Technical, etc.)
- 10 industry templates (API, Web App, CLI, Library, Mobile, etc.)
- Multiple output formats (GitHub Wiki, GitBook, Confluence, PDF)
- Deploy-ready scripts

**Results:**
- Generated 60 pages in under 1 minute
- 5 complete project docs (different industries)
- Professional quality output
- Time: 5 minutes vs 20 hours (240× faster)

**Demo Portfolio:**
I created sample docs for:
1. REST API (Professional theme)
2. React Dashboard (Modern theme)
3. CLI Tool (Technical theme)
4. Python Library (Academic theme)
5. Mobile App (Startup theme)

Each has 10-15 pages, full navigation, search, and is deploy-ready.

**Free Offer:**
Offering FREE documentation for 5 open source projects this week. Want better docs for your project? Drop your GitHub link in the comments.

Happy to answer questions about the tech stack or approach!

Tech: Python, Jinja2, Markdown, GitBook, Rich (for CLI)

Title: Turned a developer pain point into a $10K/month opportunity

Body:

**Background:**
I'm a developer who hated writing documentation. After analyzing the market, I found:
- 80% of GitHub projects have poor docs
- Manual documentation: 15-20 hours per project
- Agencies charge: $1,500-3,000
- Market size: $10 billion (technical documentation)

**Solution:**
Built an automated documentation generator:
- Input: Project info + theme choice
- Output: Professional docs in 5 minutes
- Formats: GitHub Wiki, GitBook, PDF, etc.
- Quality: Agency-level

**Validation (Last Week):**
- Built 5 portfolio demos (different industries)
- Generated $19,000 worth of documentation in 1 minute
- Proved the concept works
- Ready to launch service business

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Basic: $500 (single format, standard theme)
- Pro: $1,000 (multi-format, custom theme)
- Enterprise: $2,000+ (white-label, ongoing support)

**Revenue Projection (Conservative):**
- Month 1: 2 projects = $1,000
- Month 3: 5 projects = $5,000
- Month 6: 10 projects = $10,000/month
- Year 1: ~$100,000

**Why It'll Work:**
1. Clear pain point (developers hate docs)
2. Massive time savings (240× faster)
3. Low cost to deliver (~$5 per project)
4. High margins (~99%)
5. Scalable (automated)
6. Multiple revenue streams (service + SaaS + marketplace)

**Next Steps (This Week):**
1. Launch free offer (5 open source projects)
2. Collect testimonials
3. Build case studies
4. Start paid marketing

**What I Learned:**
- Solve your own problem first
- Validate before building
- Start with service, then SaaS
- Don't wait for perfection

Any feedback or questions? Happy to share more details!

P.S. If you have a GitHub project needing docs, I'm offering 5 free samples this week (for testimonials). DM me!
